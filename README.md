# DAY 001 - Profile Card Project

The **Profile Card** project is a simple ReactJS application designed to display user profile information in a visually appealing card format. It demonstrates the use of modern React concepts and styling techniques.

## Concepts Used

- **React Components**: Breaking the UI into reusable components.
- **Props**: Passing data between components.
- **State Management**: Managing dynamic data within components.
- **CSS Modules/Styling**: Applying custom styles to components.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the card looks good on different screen sizes.

This project is a great starting point for understanding React fundamentals and building interactive UIs.
